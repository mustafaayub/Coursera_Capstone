Almost half its population was born outside Canada. Multiculturalism has proven to be the backbone of Toronto and a key strength. One of the key factors bringing people together in such a multicultural city is variety of food. While a mix of multicultural and ethnic foods remain a bonding factor among people, there are some other food items that are in high demand by everyone; regardless of their ethnicity or background. Let\u2019s take an example - Pizza!!!\n\nAccording to a report by the *Technomic[^2]*, Pizza remains one of the most popular and cravable foods in the foodservice landscape. It is simple food, yet comes with sharable portions, can be enjoyed in the venue, or takeout to the parks / home / birthday & office parties, etc.  \n\n*Footnotes:*  \n[^1]: https://populationstat.com/canada/toronto  \n[^2]: https://www.technomic.com/reports/consumer/consumer-trend-reports/pizza"

The data is in a tabular format and we can use different techniques (i.e., BeautifulSoup) to retrieve the information form the Wikipedia table. This data will help provide the list of the following Pieces of information:  \n* Postal Code\n* Borough Name\n* Neighborhood Name\n    \n---\n\n\n**2.\tGeographical coordinates of Toronto:**  [Geospatial_data](https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data)  \nThis data (.cvs file) will allow us to obtain the geospatial coordinates of each borough that will help us during our data analysis along with the data obtained from Wikipedia and Foursquare API. This file will allow us to pull the following info:    \n* Postal Code\n* Latitude\n* Longitude\n\n---\n\n**3.\tFrom Foursquare API:**  [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs)  \nFoursquare is a social location service that allows users to explore the world around them. The Foursquare API allows application developers to interact with the Foursquare platform and obtain necessary info; i.e., pull a list of venues along with its features, etc. For this project, I will be interested more into the following data fields (just to name a few) in order to be able to navigate through Toronto, build clusters, etc.:  \n\n* Neighborhood\n* Neighborhood Latitude and Longitude\n* Venue\n* Venue category, etc."
